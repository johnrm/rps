        <h3>About the game</h3>
        <div class="about">
            <p>Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game played to settle disputes between two people. Thought to be a game of
                chance that depends on random luck similar to flipping coins or drawing straws, the game is often
                taught to children to help them settle arguments between themselves on their own without adult
                intervention. However, the game actually can be a game that has an element of skill that requires
                quick thinking and perceptive reasoning.</p>
            <p>The game is played with three possible hand signals that represent a rock, paper, and scissors. The
                rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing
                downward; and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the
                opposing player. Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against
                paper. If both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until
                there is a clear winner.</p>
            <p>The hand signals are given simultaneously by both players. The ritual used to get players in sync
                with each other so they can deliver their throws simultaneously is called the prime. This action
                requires retracting the playerâ€™s fist from full-arm extension towards the shoulder and then back to
                full extension. To ensure a fair match the players must be in sync with their primes. Players must
                determine before play how many times they pump their arms during the prime phase, usually two or
                three times before the final delivery of their throw.</p>
            <p>If you would ike to 'level-up' have a look online for 'Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard' for an
                interesting twist to this simple game!</p>
